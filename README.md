# Hotel-R-Project
Hotel Review Sentiment and Trend Analysis
This repository contains the R scripts, datasets, and analysis reports for a Data Mining Group Project focused on mining insights from hotel reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and clustering techniques.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to uncover the underlying sentiments, themes, and trends within hotel reviews to assist hotel management in making informed decisions. It involves an exploratory analysis, preprocessing of textual data, sentiment analysis, trend identification, and clustering using k-means.

Repository Structure
data/: Contains the raw dataset of hotel reviews as well as any intermediate datasets generated after cleaning and preprocessing.
scripts/: R scripts used for analysis, including data cleaning, preprocessing, text mining, clustering, and visualization.
docs/: Documentation and reports, including milestone reports and the final study report.
figures/: Graphs and plots generated during the exploratory and final analysis.
appendix/: Extended model outputs and additional materials that support the analysis.
Installation
To run the scripts, you will need R and RStudio installed on your machine.

Install R from The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).
Install RStudio from RStudio's website.
Usage
To run the analysis:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Open the R scripts located in the scripts/ directory with RStudio.
Install any required R packages using the command install.packages("package_name").
Set the working directory to the repository's root using the setwd("path_to_repository") command.
Run the scripts in the order specified in the scripts/README.md file.
